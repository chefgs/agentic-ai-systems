# Agentic AI Systems

This repository contains experiments and proof-of-concept (POC) developments for agentic AI systems. It showcases how to build AI agent systems that can collaborate to solve tasks in a human-in-the-loop workflow.

## Repository Structure

- `python-app-development-agent/`: The main implementation of a multi-agent application development system
  - `product-dev-agentic-ai.py`: The core agent orchestration script
  - `what-is-this-system.md`: Detailed explanation of the system
  - `generated_code/`: Directory where code generated by the agents is stored with timestamps
  - `transcripts/`: Directory where conversation transcripts are stored
  - `workspace/`: Working directory where the agent can write and execute code

## What is This System?

This is an AI agent system built with [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) that simulates a cross-functional product development team consisting of:

1. **Product Manager (PM)**: Clarifies requirements and creates specifications
2. **Developer**: Writes clean, production-friendly code based on the PM's specifications
3. **QA Engineer**: Reviews code and suggests improvements or tests

The system uses large language models (LLMs) to power these agents and includes a human-in-the-loop approach where you (the human) can approve actions before they are executed.

## Key Features

- **Multi-agent collaboration**: Agents with different roles collaborate to build software
- **Human-in-the-loop**: You control when and how agents interact with your filesystem
- **Safe file operations**: File writes are constrained to the workspace directory
- **Limited shell execution**: Only whitelisted commands can be executed
- **Transcript recording**: All agent conversations are saved for future reference
- **Flexible LLM support**: Works with OpenAI models or local models through Ollama

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chefgs/agentic-ai-systems.git
   cd agentic-ai-systems
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pyautogen openai streamlit
   ```

3. For local LLM support (optional):

   ```bash
   # Install Ollama (macOS)
   brew install ollama
   ollama serve
   
   # Pull a model
   ollama pull llama3:8b
   ```

## Configuration

Set up your environment variables based on your preferred LLM provider:

### OpenAI (Cloud)

```bash
export MODEL_PROVIDER=openai
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini  # Optional, defaults to gpt-4o-mini
```

### Ollama (Local)

```bash
export MODEL_PROVIDER=ollama
export OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1  # Default Ollama endpoint
export OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3:8b  # Or any other model you've pulled
```

## How to Run

Navigate to the python-app-development-agent directory and run the main script:

```bash
cd python-app-development-agent
python product-dev-agentic-ai.py
```

Follow the prompts:

1. Enter a feature request (e.g., "Build a CLI that reverses a string")
2. The system will initiate a conversation between the PM, Developer, and QA
3. You'll be prompted to approve writing the generated code to the workspace
4. After completion, the transcript is saved and the generated code is stored

## Sample Applications

The system has been used to develop various applications such as:

- Streamlit applications for comparing LLM models
- CLI tools with simple functionality
- Python utilities with tests

## Understanding the Output

After running the system, you'll get:

- **Generated code**: Saved in `generated_code/` with timestamps
- **Conversation transcripts**: Saved in `transcripts/` with timestamps
- **Working application**: Available in the `workspace/` directory if you approved it

## How to Extend

You can extend this system by:

- Adding more agent roles
- Implementing additional tools for the agents
- Configuring different LLM models
- Adding automated testing and deployment workflows
