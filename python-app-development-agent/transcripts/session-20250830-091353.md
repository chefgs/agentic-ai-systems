### PM: Requirements Specification

**Feature Title:** Streamlit Application for User Prompts and OpenAI GPT Responses

**Objective:** Create a simple Streamlit application that allows users to input a prompt and receive a response from OpenAI's GPT model.

**Scope:**
1. User Interface:
   - A text input box for user prompts.
   - A submit button to send the prompt.
   - A display area for the GPT response.

2. Backend Integration:
   - Connect to OpenAI's API to fetch responses based on user input.

3. Error Handling:
   - Display error messages for invalid inputs or API errors.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The application should have a functional UI with a text input and a submit button.
2. Upon submitting a prompt, the application should display the response from OpenAI's GPT model.
3. If the API call fails, the application should show an appropriate error message.
4. The application should be deployable on Streamlit sharing or similar platforms.

**MVP Deliverables:**
- Streamlit application with the above features.
- Basic error handling for API failures.
- Documentation on how to run the application locally.

### Dev: Minimal Code Proposal

```python
import streamlit as st
import openai

# Set your OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

def get_gpt_response(prompt):
    try:
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
        )
        return response.choices[0].message['content']
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"

# Streamlit UI
st.title("GPT Prompt Application")
user_prompt = st.text_input("Enter your prompt:")
if st.button("Submit"):
    if user_prompt:
        response = get_gpt_response(user_prompt)
        st.write("Response:", response)
    else:
        st.error("Please enter a prompt.")

```

**Tests:**
- Test for valid prompt submission and correct response display.
- Test for empty prompt submission and appropriate error message.
- Test for API failure handling.

---

### QA: Review and Suggestions

**Review:**
- The code meets the basic requirements for the MVP.
- The UI is simple and functional.
- Error handling is in place for API failures.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1. **Input Validation:** Add more robust validation for user input (e.g., length checks).
2. **Loading Indicator:** Implement a loading spinner while waiting for the API response to improve user experience.
3. **Styling:** Consider adding some basic CSS or Streamlit themes for better UI aesthetics.
4. **Logging:** Implement logging for API calls and errors for better debugging and monitoring.

**Next Steps:**
- Implement the suggested improvements if time permits.
- Prepare for deployment and user testing.

### Developer

```python
# file: app.py
import streamlit as st
import openai

# Set your OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

def get_gpt_response(prompt):
    """Fetch response from OpenAI's GPT model."""
    try:
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
        )
        return response.choices[0].message['content']
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"

# Streamlit UI
st.title("GPT Prompt Application")
user_prompt = st.text_input("Enter your prompt:")
if st.button("Submit"):
    if user_prompt:
        with st.spinner("Fetching response..."):  # Loading indicator
            response = get_gpt_response(user_prompt)
        st.write("Response:", response)
    else:
        st.error("Please enter a prompt.")

# Note: Remember to replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual OpenAI API key.
```

### QA Review and Suggestions

**Review:**
- The code implementation is clean and follows the requirements specified by the PM.
- The addition of a loading spinner enhances user experience while waiting for the API response.
- The error handling for API failures is present, which is good for user feedback.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1. **Input Validation:**
   - Implement length checks for the user prompt to ensure it is neither too short nor excessively long. For example, you might want to set a minimum length of 5 characters and a maximum of 500 characters.
   
2. **Error Handling:**
   - Instead of returning a generic error message, consider differentiating between types of errors (e.g., network issues, invalid API key, etc.) to provide more specific feedback to the user.

3. **Logging:**
   - Implement logging for API calls and errors. This will help in debugging and monitoring the application in production. You can use Python's built-in `logging` module.

4. **Testing:**
   - Ensure that the application is tested thoroughly. Consider edge cases such as:
     - Submitting a prompt that is exactly at the minimum or maximum length.
     - Submitting special characters or empty strings.
     - Handling rate limits from the OpenAI API.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Include a README file with instructions on how to set up and run the application, including how to obtain and set the OpenAI API key.

### Minimal Pytest Test File

Here’s a minimal pytest test file to cover the basic functionality of the application:

```python
# file: test_app.py
import pytest
from app import get_gpt_response

# Mocking the OpenAI API response
class MockOpenAI:
    @staticmethod
    def ChatCompletion_create(model, messages):
        if messages[0]['content'] == "error":
            raise Exception("API error")
        return MockResponse()

class MockResponse:
    @property
    def choices(self):
        return [MockChoice()]

class MockChoice:
    @property
    def message(self):
        return {'content': "This is a mock response."}

# Test valid prompt submission
def test_valid_prompt(monkeypatch):
    monkeypatch.setattr("openai.ChatCompletion.create", MockOpenAI.ChatCompletion_create)
    response = get_gpt_response("Hello, GPT!")
    assert response == "This is a mock response."

# Test empty prompt submission
def test_empty_prompt():
    response = get_gpt_response("")
    assert response.startswith("Error:")

# Test API failure handling
def test_api_failure(monkeypatch):
    monkeypatch.setattr("openai.ChatCompletion.create", MockOpenAI.ChatCompletion_create)
    response = get_gpt_response("error")
    assert response == "Error: API error"

# Test prompt length validation (this would be part of the Streamlit app logic)
def test_prompt_length_validation():
    short_prompt = "Hi"
    long_prompt = "A" * 501  # Assuming max length is 500
    assert len(short_prompt) < 5  # This should be handled in the app
    assert len(long_prompt) > 500  # This should also be handled in the app
```

### Next Steps
- Implement the suggestions for improvements.
- Run the tests to ensure the application behaves as expected.
- Prepare documentation for deployment and user testing.
