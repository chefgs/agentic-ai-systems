### PM: Requirements Specification

**Feature Title:** LLM Model Comparison Streamlit Application

**Objective:** Develop a Streamlit application that allows users to compare different LLM (Large Language Model) models based on various metrics and outputs.

#### Requirements:
1. **User Interface:**
   - A dropdown menu to select between at least three different LLM models (e.g., GPT-3, GPT-4, BERT).
   - An input text box for users to enter a prompt.
   - A "Compare" button to trigger the model comparison.
   - Display area for model outputs side-by-side.
   - A section to show key differences between the models (e.g., response time, accuracy, etc.).

2. **Functionality:**
   - When a user selects models and enters a prompt, the application should:
     - Call the selected models with the input prompt.
     - Display the outputs from each model in a side-by-side format.
     - Provide a summary of differences in performance metrics.

3. **Documentation:**
   - Create a README file that explains:
     - How to run the application.
     - The differences between the selected LLM models.
     - Any dependencies required.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- The application must allow users to select at least three LLM models.
- Users can input a prompt and receive outputs from all selected models.
- Outputs are displayed side-by-side for easy comparison.
- The README file is complete and provides clear instructions and model differences.
- The application is deployed and accessible via a web link.

### Dev: Minimal Code Proposal

```python
# app.py
import streamlit as st
import time

# Dummy function to simulate LLM model responses
def get_model_response(model_name, prompt):
    time.sleep(1)  # Simulate response time
    return f"Response from {model_name} for prompt: '{prompt}'"

# Main Streamlit application
def main():
    st.title("LLM Model Comparison Tool")

    models = ["GPT-3", "GPT-4", "BERT"]
    selected_models = st.multiselect("Select LLM Models", models)
    prompt = st.text_input("Enter your prompt:")
    
    if st.button("Compare"):
        if selected_models and prompt:
            outputs = {}
            for model in selected_models:
                outputs[model] = get_model_response(model, prompt)
            
            st.write("### Model Outputs")
            for model, output in outputs.items():
                st.write(f"**{model}:** {output}")
            
            st.write("### Key Differences")
            st.write("Response time, accuracy, etc. will be displayed here.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### Tests:
- Test that the application runs without errors.
- Test that selecting models and entering a prompt produces outputs.
- Test that the outputs are displayed correctly.

---

### QA: Review and Suggestions

#### Review:
- The code meets the basic requirements for functionality and user interface.
- The use of a dummy function for model responses is acceptable for MVP but should be replaced with actual model calls in future iterations.
- The README file is not included in the code; it should be created separately.

#### Suggestions for Improvement:
1. **Error Handling:** Implement error handling for cases where model responses fail or the input prompt is empty.
2. **Performance Metrics:** Consider integrating real performance metrics for the models to provide users with more insights.
3. **Styling:** Enhance the UI with basic styling for better user experience.
4. **Deployment Instructions:** Ensure the README includes clear deployment instructions for the Streamlit app.

#### Next Steps:
- Implement the suggested improvements in the next iteration.
- Create the README file with detailed instructions and model differences.

### QA Review of README.md

#### Review:
The README file provides a clear overview of the application, instructions for running it, and a brief description of the models and their differences. However, there are areas for improvement to enhance clarity and completeness.

#### Suggestions for Improvement:
1. **Add Installation of Additional Dependencies:** If there are any additional libraries required for the application (e.g., `requests` for API calls if you plan to fetch model responses from an external service), they should be mentioned in the dependencies section.

2. **Clarify Model Response Simulation:** Since the application currently uses a dummy function to simulate model responses, it would be beneficial to clarify this in the README. This will set the right expectations for users regarding the current functionality.

3. **Deployment Instructions:** If the application is intended to be deployed on a platform like Streamlit Sharing or Heroku, include instructions for deployment.

4. **Usage Examples:** Consider adding a section with example prompts and expected outputs to help users understand how to use the application effectively.

5. **Contributing Section:** If you expect contributions from others, include a section on how to contribute to the project.

6. **Contact Information:** Provide a way for users to reach out for support or feedback.

- Ensure that the application is tested thoroughly, including edge cases, and consider writing a minimal pytest test file to validate the core functionality. 

### Minimal pytest Test File Suggestion

```python
# test_app.py
import pytest
from app import get_model_response

def test_get_model_response():
    response = get_model_response("GPT-3", "What is the capital of France?")
    assert response == "Response from GPT-3 for prompt: 'What is the capital of France?'"

def test_empty_prompt():
    response = get_model_response("GPT-3", "")
    assert response == "Response from GPT-3 for prompt: ''"  # Adjust based on expected behavior

def test_multiple_models():
    models = ["GPT-3", "GPT-4", "BERT"]
    prompt = "Tell me a joke."
    outputs = {model: get_model_response(model, prompt) for model in models}
    assert len(outputs) == len(models)  # Ensure all models return a response
```

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- What happens if the user selects no models and clicks "Compare"?
- What if the input prompt is excessively long or contains special characters?
- How does the application handle network errors if real model calls are implemented?
- Test for different combinations of model selections and prompts to ensure consistent behavior.

### QAEngineer

### QA Review of the Updated Code and README

#### Review of `app.py`
The code for the Streamlit application looks good and meets the basic requirements. Here are some observations and suggestions for improvement:

1. **User Feedback for Empty Inputs:**
   - The warning message for empty selections or prompts is a good addition. However, consider using `st.error()` instead of `st.warning()` to emphasize that the user must take action.

2. **Performance Metrics Section:**
   - The section for "Key Differences" is currently a placeholder. It would be beneficial to either provide actual metrics or remove this section until it can be populated with meaningful data.

3. **Code Structure:**
   - The code is straightforward and easy to read. However, consider separating the model response logic from the UI logic for better maintainability, especially when integrating real models in the future.

4. **Testing for Edge Cases:**
   - The application should handle cases where the user selects multiple models but enters an empty prompt, or vice versa. Ensure that the UI behaves as expected in these scenarios.

#### Review of `README.md`
The README file is comprehensive and well-structured. Here are some suggestions for improvement:

1. **Clarification on Dummy Function:**
   - The note about the dummy function is helpful. Consider adding a timeline or a "Future Work" section to indicate when real model integrations might be expected.

2. **Example Usage:**
   - The example usage section is great. You might want to include a few more examples to cover different types of prompts (e.g., factual questions, creative prompts).

3. **Dependencies:**
   - If you plan to integrate actual models in the future, mention any specific libraries (like `transformers` or `torch`) that might be needed.

4. **Contact Information:**
   - Ensure that the placeholder email is replaced with a real contact or a link to a contact form.

#### Review of `test_app.py`
The test file is a good start. Here are some suggestions for improvement:

1. **Testing Edge Cases:**
   - Add tests for scenarios where no models are selected or where the prompt is empty. This will ensure that the application handles these cases gracefully.

2. **Testing Response Time:**
   - Consider adding a test to check if the response time is within an acceptable range (e.g., less than 2 seconds). This can help ensure that performance remains optimal as the application evolves.

3. **Test for Invalid Model Names:**
   - Add a test case to check how the application behaves when an invalid model name is passed to `get_model_response`.

### Suggested Updates

#### Updated `app.py`
```python
import streamlit as st
import time

# Dummy function to simulate LLM model responses
def get_model_response(model_name, prompt):
    time.sleep(1)  # Simulate response time
    return f"Response from {model_name} for prompt: '{prompt}'"

# Main Streamlit application
def main():
    st.title("LLM Model Comparison Tool")

    models = ["GPT-3", "GPT-4", "BERT"]
    selected_models = st.multiselect("Select LLM Models", models)
    prompt = st.text_input("Enter your prompt:")
    
    if st.button("Compare"):
        if selected_models and prompt:
            outputs = {}
            for model in selected_models:
                outputs[model] = get_model_response(model, prompt)
            
            st.write("### Model Outputs")
            for model, output in outputs.items():
                st.write(f"**{model}:** {output}")
            
            st.write("### Key Differences")
            st.write("Response time, accuracy, etc. will be displayed here.")
        else:
            st.error("Please select at least one model and enter a prompt.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### Updated `test_app.py`
```python
import pytest
from app import get_model_response

def test_get_model_response():
    response = get_model_response("GPT-3", "What is the capital of France?")
    assert response == "Response from GPT-3 for prompt: 'What is the capital of France?'"

def test_empty_prompt():
    response = get_model_response("GPT-3", "")
    assert response == "Response from GPT-3 for prompt: ''"  # Adjust based on expected behavior

def test_multiple_models():
    models = ["GPT-3", "GPT-4", "BERT"]
    prompt = "Tell me a joke."
    outputs = {model: get_model_response(model, prompt) for model in models}
    assert len(outputs) == len(models)  # Ensure all models return a response

def test_no_models_selected():
    response = get_model_response("", "What is the capital of France?")
    assert response == "Response from  for prompt: 'What is the capital of France?'"  # Adjust based on expected behavior

def test_invalid_model_name():
    response = get_model_response("INVALID_MODEL", "What is the capital of France?")
    assert response == "Response from INVALID_MODEL for prompt: 'What is the capital of France?'"  # Adjust based on expected behavior
```

### Next Steps:
- Implement the suggested updates in both the application and the README.
- Enhance the test suite to cover more edge cases.
- Consider user feedback and iterate on the application to improve usability and functionality.
